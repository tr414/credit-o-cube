# Credit-O-Cube

## Description
This is a Web Application built using Spring Boot. It is a simple online banking system that allows customers to apply for and manage credit cards and bank accounts.

## Authors and acknowledgment
I worked on this project over a 2 week timeframe with 4 of my colleagues at FDM as part of our final project.<br>
We did the work in 3 sprints, with a review at the end of each sprint with our customer, to update our product backlog and refine what we do in the next sprint accordingly.<br>
It was a great learning experience on working collaboratively, as this is the first software project of this scale that I did with a team.<br>
In terms of code, I was in charge of the following:
<ul>
    <li>Implement user authentication and session management using Spring Security</li>
    <li>Design and build the business logic to allow installment payments on credit card transactions</li>
    <li>Design and build the business logic to calculate cashback, generate bills, and apply late payment fees for bills that are not paid on time</li>
    <li>Build a system to retrieve forex data from an API, to allow foreign currency transactions on the credit card.</li>
</ul>
